# O'Reilly Media Illustration Guidelines

This document will help you understand the procedure for using screenshots and technical illustrations in your project.

You can contact O'Reilly's Illustrator at <a href="mailto:dcps-illustrations@oreilly.com">dcps-illustrations@oreilly.com</a>.

## Types of Figures

There are two main types of figures: screenshots and drawn illustrations.

### Screenshots

*	Don't save screenshots as JPEGs. Please use TIF, PNG, or BMP.
*	Please capture the smallest necessary area when a full desktop screenshot is not required. The less in the screenshot, the easier it will be for your audience to read it.
*	Don't add callouts or modify your files. We'll do all of that for you; just let us know if you require callouts and supply one file with callouts added and one without. (Callouts are text, circles, lines, and arrows added to screenshots or photos that label or describe elements.)

### Drawn Illustrations

Most illustrations will be modified to fit the style of O'Reilly books. We're happy to work with you to create a refined graphic.

* Use whatever method is most comfortable for you when first creating your illlustrations: they can be sketched, described in text, or generated using a computer drawing program. 

* If you're using a program such as Visio, PowerPoint, Freehand, Illustrator, or another drawing program, please export your files as PDFs to ensure that there are no translation errors between computers.

* To help you generate the images, [we have templates in Adobe Illustrator](image-stuff.zip) and as PDFs that should be able to be opened in your vector program of choice. Just let us know you want to try your hand at them! If you do choose to work with the Illustrator templates, please send us the .ai files you create, along with exported PDFs. 

## Figure Sizing

When creating your figures or taking screenshots, please remember there are page size limitations. For most of our books, your images need to fit into a 4.8 x 7 inch space.

## Orgainizing with a Figure List

Organization is key. A well-organized figure list allows us to move your book through production more quickly and accurately. The figure list should contain the filename, position of the figure in the book, and caption for each figure. This is also where you tell us about callouts you need, whether we need to crop an image, and whether you need us to redraw something.

When creating figure lists, please use the following conventions:

1. **Fig#**: The location of the figure in the printed book.
2. **Filename**: These are the names of the files you send to us. It is very important that this information be as accurate as possible.
3. **Type/Instructions**: Let us know if an illustration needs to be drawn or touched-up by our illustrator. Please provide instructions for cropping, adding callouts, etc.
4. **Figure Caption**: These are very helpful for us when trying to make solve a figure placement problem or when we need to make sure we're working with the correct image in the right place in the book.
 
Here's an example of an ideal figure list.

Fig #   |   Filename   | Type/Instructions   |  Caption
 --- | --- | --- | ---
 1-1 | some-file-name.pdf | Drawing. Please add an arrow pointing from the outside servers to the middle servers and label it "Workflow."   | Example of server setup showing an important idea.
 1-2 | my-favorite-picture.png | Screenshot. Pleae crop tightly on the top third. | This is what the top of thee page will look like.
 1-3 | hello-world-example.png | Screenshot | The image caption would go here.
 ... | ... | ... | ...
 2-1 | my-cat.png | Screenshot | Caption goes here.
 2-2 | Michael-Stipe.pdf | Drawing. Please keep the hand-drawn look and feel. | Caption goes here.
